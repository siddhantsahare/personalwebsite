          <p>
            Swinggle was a startup that was focussed on building a platform both
            web and mobile that would help instant and safe video file sharing.
            I worked there for about 4 months along side Mayur Rokade(android),
            IIT Roorkee & Aniket karne(backend)-Wallstreet. Soon the project was
            closed due to lack of funding.
